# coroutines-retrofit-example

A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously

coroutines help to solve two primary problems:
Manage long-running tasks that might otherwise block the main thread and cause your app to freeze.
Providing main-safety, or safely calling network or disk operations from the main thread.
